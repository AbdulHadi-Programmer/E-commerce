## 🔹Phase 1 : (You Already Did)

✅ Nested Serializers → Category → Products relationship
✅ Validation logic
✅ SerializerMethodField (custom data like total_products)
✅ Clean data output

You already did amazing there! 🎉
Now we move to the manual API layer


## 🔹Phase 2: Understanding and Building with APIView
🎯 Goal:

Learn how to write custom CRUD APIs using APIView —
so you understand what’s really happening under the hood when you use ModelViewSet.

## 🧠 What is APIView?
Think of APIView like the “manual gearbox” of Django REST Framework.

- You write each HTTP method yourself (get, post, put, delete, etc.)
- Gives you full control over data flow and response.
- Used heavily in real-world production when you need business logic (like checking permissions, custom filters, user roles, etc.)
