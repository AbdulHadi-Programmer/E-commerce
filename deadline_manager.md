## 🧱 Phase 1 — Core “Deadline Manager” (Foundation)

This is the spine of your system — the structured memory of your assistant.

### 🎯 Goal
Centralize all deadlines from:

- Academic exams
- Course challenges / projects
- Personal tasks (like “apply for internship” or “review DRF section 5”)

Then trigger smart reminders, priority alerts, and summaries.

## 🧩 Data Model Design (Django ORM)

Let’s go straight to the model-level thinking:
```python
class User(AbstractUser):
    # normal Django user
    timezone = models.CharField(max_length=50, default='UTC')

class Category(models.Model):
    # e.g., "Academics", "Course", "Project", "Personal"
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Task(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    deadline = models.DateTimeField()
    priority = models.CharField(
        max_length=10,
        choices=[('Low', 'Low'), ('Medium', 'Medium'), ('High', 'High')],
        default='Medium'
    )
    status = models.CharField(
        max_length=20,
        choices=[('Pending', 'Pending'), ('In Progress', 'In Progress'), ('Completed', 'Completed')],
        default='Pending'
    )
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```
### Backend (DRF Layer)
APIs:
| Endpoint               | Purpose                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/tasks/`          | Create, view, list all tasks                  |
| `/api/tasks/<id>/`     | Update, delete, or complete a task            |
| `/api/tasks/upcoming/` | Show all deadlines within the next X days     |
| `/api/summary/today/`  | Returns a daily report of deadlines due today |

Authentication: JWT
Permissions: per-user data isolation
Async jobs: Celery for reminder scheduling (via Redis)

## 🔔 Reminder Engine (Celery + Redis)
Core logic:
* Every new task triggers a Celery job scheduled X hours before its deadline.
* Celery Beat runs daily to:
   - Check all deadlines for the next 24h
   - Send reminders (email/notification/log)

Later we can plug this into:
   - Voice notification (“You have 3 deadlines today…”)
   - Telegram bot / Discord / Email alerts

## 📅 Smart Scheduling (Phase 1.5)
Add algorithms to:
* Detect deadline clusters (too many tasks close together)
* Auto-prioritize tasks by urgency + category
* Suggest rescheduling


---

## 🧠 Phase 2 — Intelligent Interaction (Assistant Mode)

Here’s where your “Jarvis” roots start.
Instead of clicking buttons, you talk or type:
```vbnet
"Remind me to finish the AI project by Monday 6PM"
→ creates a task under "Projects" category with auto-detected deadline
```

or

```pgsql
"What deadlines do I have this week?"
→ returns a natural-language summary
```

How it works:

### 🗣️ Input Processing
Use LLM or lightweight NLP (like spaCy initially) to:

* Parse intent (create, update, query)
* Extract entities (deadline, title, category)
* Route to DRF endpoints

### 🔄 Response Generation
* Query your API (like /tasks/upcoming/)
* Generate a human-readable reply:
* “You have 3 tasks due this week — 2 academic, 1 personal.”

`Later replace the NLP layer with a small LLM model or integrate OpenAI API for full conversational tone.`

---
## 🧱 Phase 3 — Smart Frontend + Notifications
You’ll need a frontend dashboard (React or Next.js) that shows:

Task timelines
* Upcoming deadlines
* Category stats
* Daily AI summaries (“Here’s what you need to focus on today.”)

You can also expose:
* Telegram Bot or CLI interface for minimal input
* Speech Interface (via `SpeechRecognition` or `pyttsx3`) for future "talk mode"

---

## ☁️ Phase 4 — Scalable Backend Infrastructure
This is where you make it production-grade:

* Dockerize Django + Redis
* Use PostgreSQL
* Add caching for heavy queries
* Deploy to Render / AWS EC2
* Add monitoring (Sentry / Prometheus)

--- 

## 🤖 Phase 5 — Jarvis Evolution (LLM Integration)
Once your structured API is stable, plug in AI reasoning:

- Use OpenAI API (or local LLM like Llama 3.1)
- Give it access to your “Task” database
- Let it reason over your deadlines & priorities

> Example:
“I’ve noticed your course project and AI exam overlap next week. Would you like me to shift one of the reminders to earlier?”

That’s your Jarvis moment — AI that knows your schedule and reasons about it.

## Realistic Timeline

| Phase   | Goal                                               | Accelerated | Normal    |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Phase 1 | Task + Deadline backend (core CRUD + JWT + Celery) | 5–6 days    | 8–10 days |
| Phase 2 | NLP / LLM command interface                        | 4–5 days    | 6–8 days  |
| Phase 3 | Frontend dashboard / bot integration               | 5 days      | 7–9 days  |
| Phase 4 | Deployment + scaling                               | 3–4 days    | 5–6 days  |
| Phase 5 | AI + reasoning integration                         | 5–7 days    | 8–10 days |

**Total**
- Accelerated: ~22-25 days
- Normal: ~35 days 

## Why This Is Genius
Your're not building a todo app.

Your're building a cognitive system that :
- Understands your commitment 
- Talks to you naturally
- Keeps you accountable
- Can later integrate with external data sources (calender, email, etc)

This is a portfolio-defining project ——— it screams “I understand real-world backend systems.”
